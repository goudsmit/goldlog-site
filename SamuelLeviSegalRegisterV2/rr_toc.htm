<td><b><font color="#222222">The Descendants of Samuel Levi Segal Goldschmidt - born abt 1700 in Frankfurt am Main -<br />Forefather of the families Goudsmit, Bloemhof, Groenewoudt (and Löwenberg?)<i></b><br />Samuel Levi must have been still a boy when his family was forced to leave Frankfurt. They had lost everything as a result of the great fire of 1711 by which all the houses of the &#8220;Judengasse&#8221; were destroyed. They wandered through the Region north of Frankfurt, to end up in Reiskirchen in the Busecker Tal, an independant &quot;Ritterschaft&quot; nicknamed &#8220;Hessisch Palästina&#8221;. From here, in the second half of the 18th century, most of his children would migrate to the Netherlands.<br />In Frankfurt the extensive Goldschmidt Levite family had during the 17th and 16th century ramified into many branches. Some had left to towns all over Europe. Others were staying in the overcrowded family houses, like the &#8220;Goldener Schwan&#8221; and the &#8220;Korb und Wanne&#8221;, where since 1525, their forefathers had been living.<br />They originated from Nürnberg, that in 1499 had expelled all its jewish inhabitants. Mosche Goldschmidt-Schaffhausen and his wife Bela had prospered in Nürnberg during the last decades of the the 15th century, as he and his sons exceptionally were allowed to practise the craft of goldsmith. His parents and grandparents had been metalworkers or merchants as well as bankers by tradition. Maybe they have fled the pogroms of Toledo in the 14th century and wandered through France and Italy to Schaffhausen.<br />[v010213]<br /></i><br />This version comprehends the first five generations, as far as the beginning of the 20th century. <br />For a regurlarly updated sequel go to: <i><a href="http://goudsmit.home.xs4all.nl/CollateralFamiliesPersonsV2/wc_toc.htm">http://goudsmit.home.xs4all.nl/CollateralFamiliesPersonsV2/wc_toc.htm</a></i></font></td>
