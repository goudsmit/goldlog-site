In the meantime they have been living in France, where more children were born. #According to her marriage act she was 48 years old and born in september 1795 and her mother was Roosje Flip. But Roosje Flip died in 1792 and her father married again in the same year 1792; so or she was much older or her mother was not Roosje Flip, but Sara Joseph Levij. # At his Naamsaanneming dd december 1811 in Dordrecht her father stated that she was 27 years old and living in Rotterdam, which means that she was born in 1784, a great difference; but its not unusual that ages in NA-acts are (a little) different from later statements. # In her death act (dd 1863 Bergh) her parents are unknown and her age is 76, which means she was born in 1787 or 1786. # In 2 acts she is stated with the name Rebekka. According to the Naamsaanneming of her father she has a sister Rebekka, 3 years younger. Of this Rebekka there are no further data found so far. They can&#8217;t be the same woman. There is one hypothesis: While being in France (in abt 1828) Elisabeth died and Mozes married her sister Rebekka, who became the mother of Sophie (who died in 1839 in Rotterdam as daughter of Rebekka). But this is highly improbable, the more because she married (at last) in 1843 under the name Elisabeth. # All things considered (also the ages of her brothers and sisters) her birth year may well be 1786 instead of 1795]<br />[NB: In the Notoriety Act (in the HuwelijksBijlagen, 11.5.1859 s-Heerenberg) of her son Jacob she is a witness (Rebekka Gorselaar, widow of Mozes Levie Cohen) together with Carolina Cohen (sister of Jacob), who later in her death act (1908 Nijmegen) is stated as daughter of Salomon Cohen and Rebecca Goslar]</font></td></tr></table>
